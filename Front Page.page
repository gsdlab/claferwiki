Overview
========

[Clafer Wiki](https://github.com/gsdlab/claferwiki) is a wiki integrated with the Clafer compiler. 
[Clafer](http://clafer.org) is a modeling language developed at [Generative Software Development Lab](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca).
The tight integration of the Clafer compiler allows modelers to freely mix natural language text with fragments of a model expressed in Clafer. 
All model fragments on a single page are considered to be part of the same module and they can easily cross reference. 
Model fragments are entered on a wiki page using *code blocks* (see using the [plugin]()) which are transformed into HTML during page rendering.
When Clafer compiler produces the HTML output, it performs code highlighting and adds hyperlinks which allow for navigation from a clafer name 
use to that clafer's definition.
The compiler also embeds compile errors into the output. 
The integration of the compiler turns the wiki into an integrated development environment (IDE) and naturally enables collaborative modeling.
