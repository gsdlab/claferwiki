To use the Clafer plugin, you create a code block, like so:

````
~~~{.clafer .v .mxml}
model
~~~
````

Note that the .clafer **must** come first; the other tags are the same as in Clafer -?, except with the symbolic characters removed. This is because only alphanumeric characters function properly in the code block headers.
