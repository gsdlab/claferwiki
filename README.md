Clafer Wiki
===========

v0.3.3.14-8-2013

**ClaferWiki** is a wiki system integrated with [Clafer compiler](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer). [Clafer](http://clafer.org) is a lightweight yet powerful structural modeling language. ClaferWiki allows for embedding Clafer model fragments in wiki pages and provides model authoring support including code highlighting, parse and semantic error reporting, hyperlinking from identifier use to its definition, and graphical view rendering. 

ClaferWiki supports informal-to-formal modeling, that is, gradually refining parts of specification in natural language into a Clafer model fragments. ClaferWiki supports *literate modeling* - both the rich text and the model fragments can be freely mixed. Informal-to-formal modeling is important during domain modeling. 

Also, ClaferWiki acts as a collaborative, lightweight, web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Clafer. In addition to code highlighting, error reporting, hyperlinking, and graphical view rendering, it also provides model versioning and distributed online/offline editing capabilities as it is based on the Git distributed version control system and the [Gitit wiki](http://gitit.net/).

To see the wiki in action, visit a live instance which contains many example models in Clafer [ModelWiki](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca:5001).

Getting Clafer Tools
--------------------

Binary distributions of Clafer, ClaferIG, and ClaferWiki for Windows, Mac, and Linux, can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/node/516). 
Clafer Wiki requires Haskell Platform and MinGW to run on Windows. 

In case these binaries do not work on your particular machine configuration, the tools can be easily built from source code, as described below.

The following tools are not part of the binary distribution and they have to be downloaded separately:

* [ClaferMOO](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooStandalone) is a set of scripts in Python (cross-platform). 
* [ClaferMooVisualizer](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooVisualizer) is a client/server web application written JavaScript.
* [ClaferConfigurator](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferConfigurator) is a client/server web application written JavaScript.

### Dependencies for running

* [Clafer compiler](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer/) 0.3.3
* [The Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform) 2013.2.0.0
  * alternatively, GHC 7.6.3
* [Git](http://git-scm.com) 
* [Gitit wiki](http://gitit.net) 0.10.3.1
  
### Installation

1. install the Haskell Platform
2. install Git
3. install Clafer compiler from source code in some `<source directory>` where you want to have the wiki source code,
4. execute `git clone git://github.com/gsdlab/claferwiki.git`
5. execute `make dependencies` to install `pandoc` with code highlighting support and `gitit` 
6. execute `make install to=<target directory>`
  * this will copy the wiki files and `cabal install` the package `claferwiki`

### Important: Branches must correspond

Clafer, ClaferIG, ClaferWiki, ClaferMoo, and ClaferMooVisualizer are following the *simultaneous release model*. 
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development. 
When building the tools, the branches should match:
Releases `clafer/master` and `claferIG/master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions `clafer/develop` and `claferIG/develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.


Usage
=====

* in the `<target directory>` execute `claferwiki.sh` to start the wiki server

Wiki can be configured by editing the `gitit.cnf` file. See [Configuring and customizing gitit](http://gitit.net/README#configuring-and-customizing-gitit).

Update
------

* in the `<source directory>` execute `git pull` 
* execute `make update to=<target directory>` 
  * this will keep the directory structure and your existing git repository with the wiki contents

* syntax coloring for Clafer models
* linking from clafer name references within model fragments to clafer definitions
* linking from clafer names used in wiki text to clafer definitions
* pop-up information about clafers in graph rendering
* translating constraints to controlled natural language and showing as pop-up?
* overview with graph rendering, statistics, and download links for the entire model source and self-contained HTML rendering

Using Clafer Wiki
-----------------

For general usage information for the GitIt wiki see the [README](http://gitit.net/README).

You can insert code blocks with clafer code anywhere in the page as follows:


\`\`\`clafer

`<here goes your model fragment>`

\`\`\`

The model overview, including the graph, stats, and download links, can be added as follows:

\`\`\` `{.clafer .summary}`

`<the contents in this block are ignored>`

\`\`\`

To have the code blocks correctly processed, make sure to add an empty line before and after the code block, even if the code block is the last element on the page.

How it works
------------

* Clafer Wiki is a set of plugins for the GitIt wiki which processes clafer code blocks and invokes the Clafer compiler.
* All code blocks on a single page are interpreted as a single module.
* The Clafer compiler generates HTML rendering of each code block.
* The rendering is enriched with:
  * links to the definitions for super clafers (inheritance)
  * links to the types of references
  * compiler error highlights
